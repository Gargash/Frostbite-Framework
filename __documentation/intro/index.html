	<h1>What is Frostbite Framework?</h1>
	<p>
		Frostbite Framework is a light weight MVC framework, based off of codeignitor. The advantage to using a framework is it allows you create a full blown CMS ten
		times faster then writting one from scratch. Frostbite also comes with a few libraries and helper functions to make it as easy and painless as possible.
	</p>
	
	<p>	
		So what is the difference between CI and Frostbite? Well for starts, Frostbite uses namespacing. This allows freedom when deciding on a page name, or a class name for
		your new class. Second, Frostbite loads twice as fast as CI's. One of the things i dislike about CI is how much code they have to use to load a single page, And that
		doesnt include all the time it takes to load the additional resources one might need to use. Now, Dont get me wrong, CI is a very fast framework, Faster
		then most, and its has very clean, and documented code. I also feel that CI just has "too much" stuff in it. Yes its nice to have resources, but i also
		believe that the people building on a framework should have enough know how to make those resources themselves, when they need it, which brings me to my third point. 
		Frostbite has very little, and extendable code. The code is very easy to understand and follow.
